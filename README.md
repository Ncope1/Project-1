# Queen Bey Trivia!
The objective of this project was to create a trivia game. I created a six (6) question trivia based on Pop Artist, Beyoncé and her personal/professional life.

## Brief example of rendered Trivia

## List of Features
* One question and a set of answer options are displayed when the page renders

* Trivia progresses to the next page when an answer option is selected and a one point score is shown if the question is answered correctly

* Once all questions have been answered, “Game Over” is displayed on the final page along with the user’s final score
